# WGS84-ED50 Transformation
This project's aim to convert WGS84 coordinates to ED50(European Datum-1950). In the world, there are still some goverment agency that uses ED50 datum sytstem. So we might need to convert WGS84(World Geodetic System-84) to ED50.
The Math.Js library is used in the project.
Please do not hesistate in case you want to ask a question.
